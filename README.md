# Hello! This is a directory created to explore people analytics, including data science specific modelling techniques. It will first follow the Handbook of Regression Modeling in People Analytics by Keith McNulty found here <!https://peopleanalytics-regression-book.org/>. This project is an application of these techniques, on the Persuasion for Good dataset collected by MIT's Wang et al. (2019). The original paper and dataset can be found at (https://gitlab.com/ucdavisnlp/persuasionforgood/tree/master/data).

If you liked this project, give it a star, and check out my RStudio mentorship! If this reminds you of something similar, please let me know by emailing me at cmokoth@ncsu.edu (I love trying new things). If you want to give me a job, my LinkedIn is linked in the sidebar.
